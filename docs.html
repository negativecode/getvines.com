title: Vines cloud - Overview
---
<h2>Vines Cloud Overview</h2>
<p>
  The Vines cloud service includes a real-time XMPP messaging system as well as
  a RESTful API for storage.  Several apps can be hosted under a single Vines cloud
  account, each with their own isolated message channels and database. This is
  particularly useful for running testing and production environments for a
  single app.
</p>

<h3>Publish/Subscribe XMPP Channels</h3>
<p>
  Apps connect to the Vines cloud XMPP server to exchange real-time messages
  with each other over pubsub channels.  For example, a game might create
  a channel called <em>game-1</em> to which the app subscribes in order to
  exchange moves and scores between two players.
</p>
<p>
  This is a bit different than mobile push messages available for iOS and Android
  devices.  While those services are designed for relatively infrequent alerts and
  notifications, Vines cloud delivers your messages instantly, within a few
  milliseconds of sending them.  Vines is designed for real-time interaction
  between devices.
</p>
<p>
  We'll have a quick start guide ready for the private beta. Stay tuned!
</p>

<h3>RESTful Database API</h3>
<p>
  The database storage service in Vines cloud allows apps to save JSON data
  to the cloud without worrying about configuring complex server software. All
  database features (create, update, delete, and query) are exposed with a
  RESTful web service API.
</p>
<p>
  We'll have more information on the specifics of the API as we get closer to
  launching the private beta.
