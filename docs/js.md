# Vines Cloud JavaScript API

The JavaScript client library wraps the REST and XMPP APIs in an easy-to-use library for HTML5 web apps.  It's open source and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/negativecode/vines-cloud-js).

The library's [README](https://github.com/negativecode/vines-cloud-js/blob/master/README.md) file gives a good overview of its features, while we're working on the full documentation here.
