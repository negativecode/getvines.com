# Vines Cloud iOS API

The iOS client library wraps the REST and XMPP APIs in an Objective-C library for use in iPhone and iPad apps.  It's open source and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/negativecode/vines-cloud-ios).

The library's [README](https://github.com/negativecode/vines-cloud-ios/blob/master/README.md) file gives a good overview of its features, while we're working on the full documentation here.
