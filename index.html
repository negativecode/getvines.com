    <h2>Real-time messages between your apps</h2>
    <p>
      Games, group chat, dashboards, live collaboration and notifications are perfect
      apps for two-way, real-time data. Your application can simply
      send and receive messages and let Vines cloud worry about routing them

    <h2>Lightning fast database storage</h2>
    <p>
      Deploying and maintaing database servers is a complex task that distracts
      from building a great user experience in your app. Vines cloud provides
      a schema-less database for storing JSON documents behind a RESTful API.
      No tables to define, no migrations to run. You can be storing data
      minutes after signing up.

    <h2>No lock-in with standards &amp; open source</h2>
    <p>
      Because Vines cloud is based on industry-standard XMPP technology, it works
      seamlessly with existing development frameworks and tools. And your data
      always belongs to you, so you can take it with you whenever
      you need. To top it all off, the Vines XMPP server, at the heart of the
      service, is <a href="https://github.com/negativecode/vines">open source</a>!
